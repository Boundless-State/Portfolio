We got an assignment to create our own portfolio with a weather API and a contact formula.

In this repo you will find my project that i will change to my liking once the assignment is done.

The site was required to have a custom made html structure, with JS in one separate file, html in another separate and also CSS.

I will update with my real resume when i make my portfolio that i will be using later on... since the real resume istnt finished yet.


It was a really fun task to create this. i will continue to update this to my liking.


Happy hollidays!
